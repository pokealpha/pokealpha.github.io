                <h4>Can I trust your trainers?</h4>

                <p>PokéAlpha trainers are people who have travelled far and wide to be the very best. They have deep knowledge about everything there is to know about being a Pokémon master; the best farming locations, where to find the rarest Pokémon, IV calculations, the strongest movesets for gym battles, and much much more. Most important of all, every trainer is required to have an impressive track record and regular updates proving their journey.</p>

                <p>Our trainers are hired using a rigorous set of requirements to ensure we can provide you the best experience no one else is able to. The people we work with are all people who have gained our trust over the period of a couple accounts. New trainers working for us are not permitted to train on a player's existing account; only new accounts. Any breach of this trust results in a permanent ban from our services and freezing of payment.</p>

                <p>That being said, just like hiring anybody, there is some risk involved, but we do take your account information very seriously, and will work closely with you in the case a trusted trainer goes rogue.</p>
